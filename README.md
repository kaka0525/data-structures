# data-structures

It holds sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python.

Current Data Structures in this repo:

* Single-Linked List
    * A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence; more complex variants add additional links.
    * We approached this data structure by learning the importance of writing tests, with the intent to improve our test driven development skills. Although we were't able to write every test first, we were able to sharpen those skills, and have a better understanding of both testing and the Single-Linked List data structure.
* Stack
    * A basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.
    * We modeled the Stack data structure by first writing tests. This project was quite a bit easier given the limited functionality of a stack, and the fact that we were able to use the concept of Composition to accomplish our task. We drew on the pre-existing methods of the Linked List to manage each of the tasks of our Stack.
